14. How would you convince a company to adopt Power BI? (ROI argument)
- Reduce manual reporting time by 50–80%, saving labor costs
- Data-driven decisions improve performance (e.g., boost sales or cut expenses)
- Self-service analytics reduce IT dependency
- Low cost of entry with high scalability
- Faster time to insight compared to traditional reporting

15. What security features does Power BI offer for sensitive data?
- Row-Level Security (RLS): Restrict data access by user role
- Azure Active Directory integration: User authentication
- Data encryption (at rest and in transit)
- Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps: Threat detection and monitoring
- Audit logs and usage metrics
